        YUGMA 2021 is a collective techno-cultural event of eleven ASME Student
        Sections across Kerala collaborating for the first time in solidarity
        with the social obligation and team spirit they possess.
        <br><br>
        The three-day-long technical extravaganza aims to build a strong structural
        student network and expand the knowledge curve by migrating knowledge,
        conceptualizing innovations, and creating vibrant experiences for
        students and early-career engineers.
        <br><br>
        As our tagline goes, YUGMA 2021 is an embellished ensemble of passion-driven volunteers putting their heart
        and soul into a celebration of learning.
        <br><br>
        <span>So letâ€™s raise a toast as we
        welcome you to our flagship event.</span>
